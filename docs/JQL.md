# JQL and issue search

Updated: 2026-09-09

ZZIRA uses one JQL parser and PostgreSQL compiler for the Jira REST search
resources, the browser issue navigator, saved filters, Agile board and quick
filters, service queues and SLA goals, dashboard gadgets, webhooks, and
scheduled automation. Callers add workspace and issue-security predicates
outside the compiled user expression, so aggregates and pages cannot include a
work item the viewer cannot browse.

## Implemented query behavior

- `AND`, `OR`, unary `NOT`, nested parentheses, and bare-text search;
- `=`, `!=`, `~`, `!~`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `IN`, `NOT IN`, `IS EMPTY`,
  and `IS NOT EMPTY`;
- core work-item, project, type, status/category, priority, user, label,
  version, parent, environment, component, sprint, resolution, and date fields,
  plus typed custom fields and installed-app scalar field aliases;
- `currentUser()`, `now()`, start/end of day, week, month, and year functions,
  Jira date literals, relative values such as `-5d`, and function increments
  such as `startOfMonth(-1M)`;
- immutable `WAS`, `WAS IN`, `WAS NOT`, `WAS NOT IN`, and `CHANGED` evaluation
  for retained field diffs, including `FROM`, `TO`, `BY`, `BEFORE`, `AFTER`,
  and `DURING` predicates;
- as many as seven `ORDER BY` fields with an issue-ID tie-breaker for
  deterministic paging; and
- legacy offset search plus enhanced search with seven-day opaque cursors bound
  to the JQL, workspace, and user.

The history compiler evaluates `actions`, ZZIRA's immutable ordered change log.
It compares both stored IDs and display values, so a status query can use either
the status ID or its name. Relative dates are resolved once per compilation in
UTC so all clauses in one execution share the same clock value.

## Search resources

Both methods of `/rest/api/3/search` and `/rest/api/3/search/jql`, plus
`POST /rest/api/3/search/approximate-count`, use the same compiler and
permission-filtered store query. Enhanced search defaults to issue IDs, honors
selected fields, rejects unbounded queries and offset pagination, and rejects a
cursor reused with another query, workspace, or user.

## Current limits

The search resources remain assessed as partial. The remaining PR 1 work adds
the Jira JQL reference, suggestion, parse, match, sanitize, personal-data
migration, and app-function precomputation resources; more built-in functions
and multi-value fields; project-aware validation warnings; expansion/property
selection; strong-consistency reconciliation; and snapshot/keyset semantics for
pages whose matching work items change between requests.

Some Jira history fields cannot be queried until their mutations persist a
structured diff. Unsupported functions fail during compilation instead of
being compared as literal text.
