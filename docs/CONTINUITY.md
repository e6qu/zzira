# Development continuity

Updated: 2026-09-10

This file is the short-lived handoff for the active branch. Stable scope,
dependencies, and acceptance gates are in [PLAN.md](../PLAN.md). Product and
contract status are in [CLOUD_PARITY.md](CLOUD_PARITY.md).

## Active delivery

- Branch: `feat/pr1-field-configurations`
- Base: `origin/main` after merged PR #79 (`e1b7fba`)
- Delivery unit: PR 1 — Jira Platform and project/site administration
- Pull request: [#80](https://github.com/e6qu/zzira/pull/80)
- State: field-configuration checkpoint implements all 15 pinned field
  configuration and field configuration scheme operations. One resolution
  function walks project → scheme → work type mapping → configuration and
  decides required, hidden, and help text per field; createmeta, editmeta, and
  the create dialog all advertise it, and the command path rejects a create that
  omits a required field or supplies a hidden one, so a rule is enforced rather
  than decorative. An absent rule means optional and visible, summary can be
  neither relaxed nor hidden, and the default configuration reproduces exactly
  what the command path already required. Clean migrations, the full uncached
  Go/PostgreSQL suite, vet, native and WebAssembly builds, conformance checks,
  every Playwright journey, 320 px reflow, and the light/dark axe sweep pass.
- Blockers: none

## Merged baseline

PR [#79](https://github.com/e6qu/zzira/pull/79) merged the binding of screens to
work item forms on top of
PR [#78](https://github.com/e6qu/zzira/pull/78), which merged Jira screens, tabs and
tab fields on top of
PR [#77](https://github.com/e6qu/zzira/pull/77), which merged Jira issue security
schemes and enforcement on top of
PR [#76](https://github.com/e6qu/zzira/pull/76), which merged Jira notification schemes
and issue-event delivery on top of PR
[#75](https://github.com/e6qu/zzira/pull/75), which merged Jira permission
schemes and authorization on top of
PR [#74](https://github.com/e6qu/zzira/pull/74), which merged Jira project roles on top
of PR [#73](https://github.com/e6qu/zzira/pull/73), which merged project lifecycle on top
of PR [#72](https://github.com/e6qu/zzira/pull/72), which merged Jira project
governance. PR #71 merged Jira site configuration. PR #70 merged the first PR 1 delivery and
adds durable bulk delete/move/transition work, Jira attachment lifecycle and
browser/CI hardening on top of PR [#69](https://github.com/e6qu/zzira/pull/69),
which merged the PR 0 baseline. PR 0's 22
implementation checkpoints cover saved filters and subscriptions,
expanded JQL and app functions, stable search identity and paging, Jira votes,
watches, project components, login-date functions, JSM approval/SLA functions,
and durable bulk watch/unwatch, editable-field discovery, and field edits.

PR #79's final GitHub matrix passed its required suites before merge.

## Resume here

1. Monitor PR #80 through every CI job and resolve review threads inline.
2. After merge, continue with custom field contexts and options, then the
   `/config/fieldschemes` field association surface.

## Continuity rules

- Do not infer completeness from registered routes or grouped endpoint counts.
- Do not mark a journey complete without browser evidence for its outcome.
- Do not claim base-URL-only compatibility for clients that hardcode a central
  Atlassian host.
- Preserve unrelated work, inspect the tree before editing, and commit every
  checkpoint with its tests and documentation.
